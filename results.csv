"Measuring the abundances of carbon and oxygen in exoplanet atmospheres is considered a crucial avenue for unlocking the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems 1,2 . Access to an exoplanet’s chemical inventory requires high precision observations, often inferred from individual molecular detections with low-resolution space-based 3-5 and high-resolution ground-based 6-8 facilities. Here we report the medium-resolution (R≈600) transmission spectrum of an exoplanet atmosphere between 3–5 μm covering multiple absorption features for the Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b 9 , obtained with JWST NIRSpec G395H. Our observations achieve 1.46 \(\times \) photon precision, providing an average transit depth uncertainty of 221 ppm per spectroscopic bin, and present minimal impacts from systematic effects. We detect significant absorption from CO 2 (28.5 \(\sigma \) ) and H 2 O (21.5 \(\sigma \) ), and identify SO 2 as the source of absorption at 4.1 \(\mu \) m (4.8 \(\sigma \) ). Best-fit atmospheric models range between 3 \(\times \) and 10 \(\times \) solar metallicity, with sub-solar to solar C/O ratios. These results, including the detection of SO 2 , underscore the importance of characterising the chemistry in exoplanet atmospheres, and showcase NIRSpec G395H as an excellent mode for time series observations over this critical wavelength range 10 .",https://nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05591-3,Early Release Science of the Exoplanet WASP-39b with JWST NIRSpec G395H,2023-01-09,"Astronomical instrumentation,Exoplanets"

"Transmission spectroscopy 1,2,3 of exoplanets has revealed signatures of water vapor, aerosols, and alkali metals in a few dozen exoplanet atmospheres 4,5 . However, these previous inferences with the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes were hindered by the observations’ relatively narrow wavelength range and spectral resolving power, which precluded the unambiguous identification of other chemical species — in particular the primary carbon-bearing molecules 6,7 . Here we report a broad-wavelength 0.5–5.5 µ m atmospheric transmission spectrum of WASP39 b 8 , a 1200 K, roughly Saturn-mass, Jupiter-radius exoplanet, measured with JWST NIRSpec’s PRISM mode 9 as part of the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Team program 10,11,12 . We robustly detect multiple chemical species at high significance, including Na (19 σ ), H 2 O (33 σ ), CO 2 (28 σ ), and CO (7 σ ). The non-detection of CH 4 , combined with a strong CO 2 feature, favours atmospheric models with a super-solar atmospheric metallicity. An unanticipated absorption feature at 4 µ m is best explained by SO 2 (2.7 σ ), which could be a tracer of atmospheric photochemistry. These observations demonstrate JWST’s sensitivity to a rich diversity of exoplanet compositions and chemical processes.",https://nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05677-y,Early Release Science of the exoplanet WASP-39b with JWST NIRSpec PRISM,2023-01-09,"Atmospheric chemistry,Exoplanets"

"Specific, regulated modification of RNAs is important for proper gene expression 1 , 2 . tRNAs are rich with various chemical modifications that affect their stability and function 3 , 4 . 7-Methylguanosine (m 7 G) at tRNA position 46 is a conserved modification that modulates steady-state tRNA levels to affect cell growth 5 , 6 . The METTL1–WDR4 complex generates m 7 G46 in humans, and dysregulation of METTL1–WDR4 has been linked to brain malformation and multiple cancers 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 . Here we show how METTL1 and WDR4 cooperate to recognize RNA substrates and catalyse methylation. A crystal structure of METTL1–WDR4 and cryo-electron microscopy structures of METTL1–WDR4–tRNA show that the composite protein surface recognizes the tRNA elbow through shape complementarity. The cryo-electron microscopy structures of METTL1–WDR4–tRNA with S -adenosylmethionine or S -adenosylhomocysteine along with METTL1 crystal structures provide additional insights into the catalytic mechanism by revealing the active site in multiple states. The METTL1 N terminus couples cofactor binding with conformational changes in the tRNA, the catalytic loop and the WDR4 C terminus, acting as the switch to activate m 7 G methylation. Thus, our structural models explain how post-translational modifications of the METTL1 N terminus can regulate methylation. Together, our work elucidates the core and regulatory mechanisms underlying m 7 G modification by METTL1, providing the framework to understand its contribution to biology and disease.",https://nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05565-5,Structures and mechanisms of tRNA methylation by METTL1–WDR4,2023-01-04,"Cryoelectron microscopy,RNA,RNA modification,X-ray crystallography"

"To survive, animals must convert sensory information into appropriate behaviours 1 , 2 . Vision is a common sense for locating ethologically relevant stimuli and guiding motor responses 3 , 4 , 5 . How circuitry converts object location in retinal coordinates to movement direction in body coordinates remains largely unknown. Here we show through behaviour, physiology, anatomy and connectomics in Drosophila that visuomotor transformation occurs by conversion of topographic maps formed by the dendrites of feature-detecting visual projection neurons (VPNs) 6 , 7 into synaptic weight gradients of VPN outputs onto central brain neurons. We demonstrate how this gradient motif transforms the anteroposterior location of a visual looming stimulus into the fly’s directional escape. Specifically, we discover that two neurons postsynaptic to a looming-responsive VPN type promote opposite takeoff directions. Opposite synaptic weight gradients onto these neurons from looming VPNs in different visual field regions convert localized looming threats into correctly oriented escapes. For a second looming-responsive VPN type, we demonstrate graded responses along the dorsoventral axis. We show that this synaptic gradient motif generalizes across all 20 primary VPN cell types and most often arises without VPN axon topography. Synaptic gradients may thus be a general mechanism for conveying spatial features of sensory information into directed motor outputs.",https://nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05562-8,Synaptic gradients transform object location to action,2023-01-04,"Neural circuits,Sensorimotor processing"

"Animals display substantial inter-species variation in the rate of embryonic development despite a broad conservation of the overall sequence of developmental events. Differences in biochemical reaction rates, including the rates of protein production and degradation, are thought to be responsible for species-specific rates of development 1 , 2 , 3 . However, the cause of differential biochemical reaction rates between species remains unknown. Here, using pluripotent stem cells, we have established an in vitro system that recapitulates the twofold difference in developmental rate between mouse and human embryos. This system provides a quantitative measure of developmental speed as revealed by the period of the segmentation clock, a molecular oscillator associated with the rhythmic production of vertebral precursors. Using this system, we show that mass-specific metabolic rates scale with the developmental rate and are therefore higher in mouse cells than in human cells. Reducing these metabolic rates by inhibiting the electron transport chain slowed down the segmentation clock by impairing the cellular NAD + /NADH redox balance and, further downstream, lowering the global rate of protein synthesis. Conversely, increasing the NAD + /NADH ratio in human cells by overexpression of the Lactobacillus brevis NADH oxidase Lb NOX increased the translation rate and accelerated the segmentation clock. These findings represent a starting point for the manipulation of developmental rate, with multiple translational applications including accelerating the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells for disease modelling and cell-based therapies.",https://nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05574-4,Metabolic regulation of species-specific developmental rates,2023-01-04,"Differentiation,Embryogenesis,Pluripotency"

"Organic carbon buried in marine sediment serves as a net sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide and a source of oxygen 1 , 2 . The rate of organic carbon burial through geologic history is conventionally established by using the mass balance between inorganic and organic carbon, each with distinct carbon isotopic values (δ 13 C) 3 , 4 . This method is complicated by large uncertainties, however, and has not been tested with organic carbon accumulation data 5 , 6 . Here we report a ‘bottom-up’ approach for calculating the rate of organic carbon burial that is independent from mass balance calculations. We use data from 81 globally distributed sites to establish the history of organic carbon burial during the Neogene (roughly 23–3 Ma). Our results show larger spatiotemporal variability of organic carbon burial than previously estimated 7 , 8 , 9 . Globally, the burial rate is high towards the early Miocene and Pliocene and lowest during the mid-Miocene, with the latter period characterized by the lowest ratio of organic-to-carbonate burial rates. This is in contrast to earlier work that interpreted enriched carbonate 13 C values of the mid-Miocene as massive organic carbon burial (that is, the Monterey Hypothesis) 10 , 11 . Suppressed organic carbon burial during the warm mid-Miocene is probably related to temperature-dependent bacterial degradation of organic matter 12 , 13 , suggesting that the organic carbon cycle acted as positive feedback of past global warming.",https://nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05413-6,Neogene burial of organic carbon in the global ocean,2023-01-04,Carbon cycle

"The introduction of volatile-rich subducting slabs to the mantle may locally generate large redox gradients, affecting phase stability, element partitioning and volatile speciation 1 . Here we investigate the redox conditions of the deep mantle recorded in inclusions in a diamond from Kankan, Guinea. Enstatite (former bridgmanite), ferropericlase and a uniquely Mg-rich olivine (Mg# 99.9) inclusion indicate formation in highly variable redox conditions near the 660 km seismic discontinuity. We propose a model involving dehydration, rehydration and dehydration in the underside of a warming slab at the transition zone–lower mantle boundary. Fluid liberated by dehydration in a crumpled slab, driven by heating from the lower mantle, ascends into the cooler interior of the slab, where the H 2 O is sequestered in new hydrous minerals. Consequent fractionation of the remaining fluid produces extremely reducing conditions, forming Mg-end-member ringwoodite. This fractionating fluid also precipitates the host diamond. With continued heating, ringwoodite in the slab surrounding the diamond forms bridgmanite and ferropericlase, which is trapped as the diamond grows in hydrous fluids produced by dehydration of the warming slab.",https://nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05392-8,Extreme redox variations in a superdeep diamond from a subducted slab,2023-01-04,"Mineralogy,Petrology"

"Measuring the metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio in exoplanet atmospheres is a fundamental step towards constraining the dominant chemical processes at work and, if in equilibrium, revealing planet formation histories. Transmission spectroscopy e.g., 1,2 provides the necessary means by constraining the abundances of oxygen- and carbon-bearing species; however, this requires broad wavelength coverage, moderate spectral resolution, and high precision that, together, are not achievable with previous observatories. Now that JWST has commenced science operations, we are able to observe exoplanets at previously uncharted wavelengths and spectral resolutions. Here we report time-series observations of the transiting exoplanet WASP-39b using JWST’s Near InfraRed Camera (NIRCam). The long-wavelength spectroscopic and short-wavelength photometric light curves span 2.0 – 4.0 µm, exhibit minimal systematics, and reveal well-defined molecular absorption features in the planet’s spectrum. Specifically, we detect gaseous H 2 O in the atmosphere and place an upper limit on the abundance of CH 4 . The otherwise prominent CO 2 feature at 2.8 µm is largely masked by H 2 O. The best-fit chemical equilibrium models favour an atmospheric metallicity of 1–100× solar (i.e., an enrichment of elements heavier than helium relative to the Sun) and a sub-stellar carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. The inferred high metallicity and low C/O ratio may indicate significant accretion of solid materials during planet formation e.g., 3,4 or disequilibrium processes in the upper atmosphere e.g., 5,6 .",https://nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05590-4,Early Release Science of the exoplanet WASP-39b with JWST NIRCam,2023-01-09,Exoplanets

"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) 1 . Astrocytes are heterogeneous CNS-resident glial cells that participate in the pathogenesis of MS and its model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) 2,3 . However, few unique surface markers are available for the isolation of astrocyte subsets, preventing their analysis and the identification of candidate therapeutic targets; these limitations are further amplified by the rarity of pathogenic astrocytes. To address these challenges, we developed FIND-seq ( F ocused I nterrogation of cells by N ucleic acid D etection and Seq uencing), a high-throughput microfluidic cytometry method that combines encapsulation of cells in droplets, PCR-based detection of target nucleic acids, and droplet sorting to enable in-depth transcriptomic analyses of cells of interest at single-cell resolution. We applied FIND-seq to study the regulation of astrocytes characterized by the splicing-driven activation of the transcription factor XBP1, which promotes disease pathology in MS and EAE 4 . Using FIND-seq in combination with conditional knock-out mice, in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-driven genetic perturbation studies, and bulk and single-cell RNA-seq analyses of mouse EAE and human MS samples, we identified a new role for the nuclear receptor NR3C2 and its corepressor NCOR2 in limiting XBP1-driven pathogenic astrocyte responses. In summary, FIND-seq enabled the identification of a therapeutically targetable mechanism that limits XBP1-driven pathogenic astrocyte responses. FIND-seq allows the investigation of previously inaccessible cells, including rare cell subsets defined by unique gene expression signatures or other nucleic acid markers.",https://nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05613-0,Identification of astrocyte regulators by nucleic acid cytometry,2023-01-04,"Neuroimmunology,Sequencing"
